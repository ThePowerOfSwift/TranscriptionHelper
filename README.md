# Transcription Helper
This is an iOS application written in Objective-c for assisting the people who want to work out a piece of audio, in order to write it out.

Moreover, the app could be used by English or other language learners for transcribing purpose or preparation for IELTS and TOEFL exam.

It doesn't do the transcribing task for you automatically, but it is essentially a specialised player program which is optimised for the purpose of transcription.

You can choose audio files from your Music application. In addition, by putting your files in the "App Sharing Files", they are available to play.
